Tool checking some of KiCad Library Convention rules in footprints (pretty format)

Author: Micha≈Ç Stec

Tests and fixes:
- wrong module name in file header (not equal to footprint name), footprint locked (shouldn't be locked in library)
- commas in tags (should be spaces)
- reference wrong or on wrong layer (should be **REF on silkscreen)
- value wrong or on wrong layer (should be footprint name on assembly)
- font size (should be 1 x 1 mm, line 0.15 mm)
- wrong courtyard or silkscreen line width (should be 0.05 mm and 0.15 mm)
- settings that are usually not necessary in official library (autoplace cost, solder paste settings, clearance at footprint level)
- not standard 3d link (should be *.3dshapes/*.wrl), moves files to standard location in packages3d/

Additional tests:
- information if reference, value, silkscreen or courtyard line is on bottom layer (usually all are on top)
- warning if courtyard is not rounded to 0.05 mm (must be rounded)
- information if most of pads are tht and attribute is normal+insert or pads are smd and attribute is normal

Usage:
1. Make a copy of your footprint libraries and 3d models (.wrl/.wings) that you want to modify
2. Run lib_check_lin in linux console or lib_check_win.exe in windows command line
3. Enter path to directory containing .pretty libraries (program iterates over all .kicad_mod in all .pretty libraries in given location)
4. Enter path to directory containing directories with .wrl/wings files (...kicad-library/modules/packages3d)
5. Read warnings, errors and other informations, answer questions (y - yes, n - no, + ENTER)
6. Make sure the changes are OK (check in KiCad), if there were problems not fixed by lib_check... (eg. courtyard rounding)- fix manually
7. Run lib_check_lin or lib_check_win.exe again to make sure that all is fixed

This program modifies files on your computer. Enter valid paths and make backup copy of libraries and models that you want to change. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
